## About

Food delivery companies and systems has skyrocketed in recent years, driven by various factors. The convenience and ease of ordering food from the comfort of oneâ€™s home or office have made food delivery a preferred choice for many consumers. With a desire to optimize operational efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction, food delivery companies have been leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict order cancellation and to forecast their resources such as active couriers. In this project I used machine learning to predict number of orders a courier will deliver.

## Documentation

### Dataset features description
* courier_id (int) : Courier ID,

* max_unique_pickups (int) : ,
* work_start (Timestamp) : time when the courier started working
* work_finish (Timestamp) : time when the courier finished working
* late_pickups (float) : Percentage of orders that were picked up late from the vendor (during inferencing this feature gets to be the maximum acceptable late pickups)
* late_deliveries (float) : Percentage of orders that were delivered late to client (during inferencing this feature gets to be the maximum acceptable late deliveries)
